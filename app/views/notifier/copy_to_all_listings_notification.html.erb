Hi <%= @client.name %>,
Your facilities have finished updating. You chose to update the <%= @what.titleize %> from <%= @listing.title %> in <%= @listing.full_address %> to your other <% pluralize @listing.siblings.size, 'facility' %>.

Here's a quick link to your facility page: <%= client_listing_url @listing, :protocol => 'https' %>

Have a great day!
