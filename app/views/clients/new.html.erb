							<h3>What Does Your Self Storage Facility Get?</h3>
								<p>While your self storage facility is more than likely already listed on USSelfStorageLocator.com under a basic membership for free, you may want to consider activating your facility and upgrading to a Premium membership to maximize the exposure of your facility. For only $54.50 a month, having a premium listing on <strong>USSelfStorageLocator.com</strong> gives you access to:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><p><strong>Online Unit Rentals, Reservations.</strong><br/>
										At no Additional cost you’ll have the option of choosing between Online Unit Rentals (which have a higher conversion rate) or Reservations. Prospective customers will be able to rent a unit, make a reservation, or request information about your self storage facility 24/7/365.</p></li>
									<li><p><strong>Enhanced Facility Profile.</strong><br/>
										Where your can display your unit types, sizes and prices, as well as facility description, amenities, pictures and video. An interactive Google Maps and Street View of your location will also be displayed with the capability of viewing and printing directions to your self storage facility. Two other great features of the Enhanced Facility Profile are the customer reviews and social media sharing widget.</p></li>
									<li><p><strong>Call Tracking and Recording.</strong><br/>
										You will get a dedicated local or toll-free phone number. Calls to this number will be tracked and recorded. When customers call this number the call is forwarded to your facility and it’s recorded for future review and quality control purposes. If the call is not picked up on your end, and no voice mail is available, we are able to still record the customer’s caller-id information. All tracked calls and recording are available for your review in your facility account page.</p></li>
									<li><p><strong>Email Notifications/Activity Tracking.</strong><br/>
										Each time you get a new lead, an email is sent with the customer information which will include a phone number and an e-mail address. This eliminates the need to use sticky notes or paper (which may get lost) to write down important information, allowing you to follow up on leads in a more timely manner.</p></li>

							<h3>FAQs</h3>
							<strong>What sets us apart from competitors?</strong>
							<p>Our unique rentals vs. reservations model is perhaps what sets us apart the most from other self storage aggregators. Rentals offer a higher conversion rate than reservations which puts more money into your pockets. Other self storage aggregators will have customers reserve your unit. There is no obligation for customers to follow up on a reservation which can end up costing you time and money. We also provide many other services that are listed on our Features page.</p>

							<strong>How much is the membership fee? / Are there any hidden fees or charges?</strong>
							<p>The membership fee is $54.50 a month. There are no other hidden fees or charges. Once you pay this, you get access to all our features as stated.</p>

							<strong>I’m already listed on your website, why should I have a Premium membership?</strong>
							<p>Our Premium membership gives you access to many more features that are not available in our Basic membership such as top results positioning, online rentals 24/7, featured facility banner, email notifications, activity tracking, and many more!</p>

							<strong>I have a company website, why should I list my facility here?</strong>
							<p>A company website can get very expensive to market and maintain. By being part of our self storage network we guarantee your self storage facility increased online exposure and give you access to many online marketing tools tailored specifically for the self storage industry. Another reason is that increasingly consumers are using online directories/aggregators that give them the ability to search and compare products and services as well as access user ratings and reviews.</p>

							<strong>What happens if I want to discontinue my membership?</strong>
							<p>You can discontinue your membership by contacting us at any time, there is no obligation and no contract involved. Your facility listing will be downgraded to a basic listing and access to all our premium marketing tools will be discontinued. You’ll be able to still keep your basic facility listing at no charge for as long as you want.</p>

							<strong>I own multiple facilities, how do I add all of them?</strong>
							<p>You can add all your facilities with our online signup form, they are most likely all listed in our database already. You can also contact us and we’ll do it for you. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to list all your facilities.</p>

							<strong>How do people find your site?</strong>
							<p>Thousands of new visitors each month find us on major search engines like Google, Yahoo and Bing. They find us both under the organic section and in the paid and sponsored section for generic and specific terms. Visitors also find us through our social media interaction with Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and YouTube.</p>
